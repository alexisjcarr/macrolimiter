### üè† [Homepage](https://github.com/alexisjcarr/macrolimiter)

### ‚ú® [Demo](https://github.com/alexisjcarr/macrolimiter/blob/master/examples/index.js)

## Install

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

### NOTE:

This package requires a redis-server to be running.

For development: if you have a Mac, homebrew should do the trick... `brew install redis`. To start the server, type `redis-server` in your command line.

If you're on Windows, first go to the releases page of the Redis for Windows repo (https://github.com/MicrosoftArchive/redis/releases). Then download the 'Redis-x64-xxx.zip' file. You can use any version that you'd like, just make sure that you do not download the 'source code' zip. After unzipping the file, in the newly created folder, run `redis-server.exe`. A window should then appear that says `redis is running on port 6379`.

#### Example

```javascript
const { generateAPIKey, validateKey, keyLimiter } = require('macrolimiter')

/*
  Using the hashArr as a simulated db for demo purposes. It will contain hashed api keys.
*/
let hashArr = [],
  headersKey // key that will be added to headers

/*
  generateAPIKey() generates random api key object with the key and a hashed key 
  for secure storage in a db.
  
  example:
  {
    key: 'ZC51K5Z-BY8MWFE-P88N4TJ-PQ4Q434',
    hash: '$2a$10$V4pGVXNHGc0p.iRbcZDYn.Fy3ajZuwSrb.ZMFYa6c8EyYpXL7AN2O'
  }
*/

const key_ = generateAPIKey()

hashArr.push(key_.hash) // adding one hashed key to hashArr, but can add several
headersKey = key_.key

/* server */
const express = require('express')

const app = express()

/*
  User will send key (here stored as key_) on headers.

  validateKey() will check the key on headers against the passed in array of hashed 
  keys. O(n) complexity rn, so fair.

  For the keyLimiter(), pass in the max number of times you want the user to hit 
  your server before being blocked.

  COMING SOON: Ability to implement calls/time period limits (i.e. 1000 calls/day 
  would be keyLimiter({ CALL_LIMIT: 1000, TIME: '24hr' })).
*/

app.get(
  '/',
  validateKey({ HASH_ARR: hashArr }),
  keyLimiter({ CALL_LIMIT: 2 }),
  (_req, res) => {
    res.send('hi')
  }
)

app.listen(8888, () => console.log(`\n=== I'm on port 8888 ===\n`))
```
